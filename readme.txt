Topic: Oil and Gas - Unconventional Resources - Exploration

Goal: Develop an optimal sampling strategy that minimizes the number of wells required to answer the question of "will this project enable profit of M millions of dollars ?" with X% of certainty.

The workflow should look like this:

 - given an understanding (prior distributions) of geological properties in a basin as modelled by gaussian processes.
 - given a machine learning model that predicts production from the same set of geological properties in a specific location in a basin.

 - estimate oil recovery if placing W wells strategically and operating them for N years (development life horizon)
 - make an assessment of profitability (with uncertainty range). This requires an economic model underlying computations to get to expected NPV. 
 - leverage value of information to decide where to drill the next exploration well
 - simulate drilling said well and LEARNING about the REAL geological properties at that location
 - update beliefs (update the gaussian process model)

 - iterate until one of these 2 things happens first: a maximum number maxEW for maximum exploration wells is reached OR we can answer the original question of profitability in a satisfactory manner


Notes:
The data to be used as a starting point is generated by the script the folder startingdatagen named startingdatagen.py
Please create a plots folder and populate with plots that can be added to slides. All plots must have consistent styling and professional look and feel.
